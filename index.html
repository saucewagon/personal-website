                    <p>

                    Hi there! I'm a Software Developer based in Victoria, BC. I'm entering my final year at the University of Victoria for my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My goal is to benefit society by solving challenging problems. Of particular interest to me are environmental and geographic applications of technology. Some of my favourite companies are Tesla, who are accelerating the transition to electric transportation, and Khan Academy, which supports the democratization and digitization of education. 
                    <br><br>
                    Technically, I enjoy devising algorithms to solve problems, and the area of Machine Learning. I am an adept programmer in Java, but I have a breadth of experience in many other languages and technologies. 
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of technology, I also enjoy creating music, hiking and biking. I'm originally from the UK but have long called Canada home. 
                    </p>
